# Healing-in-Movement-
To create a world where individuals on the West Side of Chicago and beyond experience profound healing and transformation through trauma-informed, culturally relevant movement, integrating body, mind, and spirit that disrupts cycles of abuse. We empower trauma survivors and community members to express and heal themselves.
